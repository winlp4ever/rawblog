# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning became one of scientific subjects that arouses the most interest among students and academics in the last few years. 
This is mainly due to the wide spectrum of uses and solutions it provides to almost every imaginable field of activity. 
Machine learning applications are used in daily life: search engines (Google, Ecosia), recommender systems (Youtube, Amazon), translation (Google translate, Reverso, DeepL) and much more. 
But what is machine learning?
Multiple definitions of machine learning can be provided. Arthur Samuel, who is one of the pioneers in artificial intelligence and the inventor of the term defined it in 1959 as the “ Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”. Tom Mitchell who is also considered one of the pioneers in machine learning give a more technical definition: “A well-posed learning problem: a computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to task T and performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E”. 
For example, a spam filter is a Machine Learning program that can learn to detect spam given examples of non-spam and spam emails (labelled by users).

There are 3 main categories of machine learning:
* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning.
* We will discuss each one of these 3 in the following parts. 

## Supervised Learning

__Definition__: Supervised learning is the task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.

Depending on the nature of the output we have 2 types of supervised ML problems: 

* Regression when we want to predict a continuous output (numbers) for example: predicting the of a person from a recent image of his face. 
Note when we say a continuous output it does not necessarily that the range of the possible values should be mathematically continuous. An output is considered continuous where there a fairly high number of numeric possible and these values have a certain meaningful order. 

* Classification when we want to predict a discrete output. This means that we want to assign each input to `class/category/label`. For example: classifying emails to spam or non spam might is a classification problem and the there are two possible classes.
